# Chest-X-Ray-Diagnosis
Improving Fairness of Automated Chest X-ray Diagnosis by Contrastive Learning. The code implements supervised contrastive learning on a chest X-ray dataset to reduce bias in diagnosis across different subgroups (COVID-19, lung opacity, normal, and viral pneumonia). In supervised contrastive learning, positive samples are pairs of images with the same label from different subgroups, while negative samples are pairs of images with different labels from the same subgroup. The contrastive loss function is used to train the network to embed similar images close together and dissimilar images far apart in the embedding space, with an anchor image serving as the reference point.To further reduce bias, you replace the final output layer with a single perceptron layer, which becomes the contrastive head. This contrastive head is fine-tuned using binary cross-entropy loss to give image fairness and unbiased prediction
