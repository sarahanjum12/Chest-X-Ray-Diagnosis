# Chest-X-Ray-Diagnosis
Improving Fairness of Automated Chest X-ray Diagnosis by Contrastive Learning. The provided code implements a Siamese network architecture for supervised contrastive learning on a chest X-ray dataset aimed at reducing bias in diagnosis across various subgroups such as COVID-19, lung opacity, normal, and viral pneumonia. In this approach, positive samples are pairs of images with the same label from different subgroups, while negative samples are pairs of images with different labels from the same subgroup. The contrastive loss function used in training encourages the network to embed similar images close together and dissimilar images far apart in the embedding space.The training process involves iteratively updating the network parameters using the Adam optimizer based on the computed loss between pairs of input images.We can fine tune the model to reduce the bias which will help in image fairness and unbiased prediction
